Once lived in the darkness  
A little boy cried and hopeless  
Always look up to heaven  
Hope he could meet his parents  
But all he could see is stars  
This seems to be so far  
Maybe it’s time to get over

So I left and saw you along my way  
Saw you dance  
In the darkness so bright  
You said “Don’t need to worry, don’t need to cry  
Cause I’ll protect you  
Can you hear?”

\*“I'll believe you anyway any day.  
I’m here to walk with you, my best friend, till the end  
Fly away from where you grieve  
I’ll show you the right journey”

After all we got so close you gotta leave  
There’s a storm you said you gotta hurry  
Now you saved the village, your kindness pleased  
Now you’re in heaven, rest in peace

“Repeat \*  
no more fear”

Can’t you see you make this world breathe in peace  
The flowers bloom, the smiles are sweet like harmony  
Can’t you see we’re covered by your green light  
You are our new history
