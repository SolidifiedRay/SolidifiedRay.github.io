Exaction
Mentation
Feel like stagnation

I’ve turned a shunt
Find direction
I left in broken night

Evaluation
Progression
Take me to perfection

Ascension
Revolution
It’s time for brand new world inception

Humanity
Face currently
Intent to my mission

Don’t wanna cut
Don’t wanna quit
Let me be evocation

Optymization
We’ve all wanted last somehow
Labyrinth, labyrinth

Oh I’m waiting for the cyber world
Waiting for the virtual world
No one can I wonder why/how
Get turn around
Turn around instantly

I want to blur my choking sound
Waiting for my brave new world
Sirens sirens sirens It’s time your world
Get turn around
Turn around
Feel the frontier

Turn around
Turn around everything

Turn around
Turn around instantly
