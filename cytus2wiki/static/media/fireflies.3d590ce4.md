I'm standing in a world of illusion  
and the walls around just disappear  
Surround me now they’re calling  
For the meaning of this truth to show

Cause when I saw you  
I felt the ground open up beneath  
And for the first time I felt reality escape from me  

\*And through the light  
The darkness vanished as you came to life  
And through your eyes  
Came a person who I felt interfered, with my fireflies  
My fireflies  
The dream that came to find my fireflies within, is something I think was true﻿

Repeat \*
