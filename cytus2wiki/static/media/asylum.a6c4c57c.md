(Where are you now?)

And your back's against the wall

(Where are you now?)

You thought you had it all

(Where are you now?)

Getting complacent, ready to hear the truth?

Fxxking make a move

Fighting, yourself for forgiveness from all of your past mistakes

Ignoring the fact that you're

learning

Nothing, if you cling on to all of your sense of security

Will you realize

That you're not alone

(Where are you now?)

And your back's against the wall

(Where are you now?)

You thought you had it all

(Where are you now?)

Getting complacent, ready to hear the truth?

Your feelings start to die

Wasting away all your energy

Living a lie in monotony

In your little cage

And you've despised your life

Fxxking terrified all that you've known

Has been falsified, running out of time

Blaming circumstance

It's such a pity that you won't understand or don't even try

Is it fear that'll break you apart

So far, you'll take your chances

Finding solace

In the madness they put you in

Content, with your preconceptions of life

Taken away

Your right to think

Your right to dream

Can't you see the irony

Taught into society

Told that you're worthless if you don't

If you don't obey

What can they do

What can say

Faking your apologies

Thinking of what could've been

If you let go
