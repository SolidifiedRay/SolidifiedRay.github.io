If there's ever a way to escape  
If there's ever a way to escape  
I will give whatever it takes or pays  
if only someone could have hold my hand tight  
But all I hear  
is the SOS cried by myself

\*I'm the only one to break through  
facing everything cruel  
the one that's left behind and to be forgotten  
Somehow I know I have to stand  
call out the strength that's thrown away  
One day I'll fly up high again  
It's just hard to stand against the dark  
I cried and gave up what I had  
to live a life that's easier to get alone with  
abandoned all the treasure that  
I had once possessed

Repeat \*

...Never going to let go  
give in to what's ahead  
I've waited long enough  
Now it's time to fly  
Never a minute will I stay  
For all the force that I have regained  
This is the moment I will stand
