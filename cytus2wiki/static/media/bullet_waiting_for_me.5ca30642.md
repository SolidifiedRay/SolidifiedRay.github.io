Standing on the open shore  
In a world of disarray  
Cause the chaos is a warm embrace

As the fire hits my body  
And my conscience is consumed  
Nothing left of me but you, yeah

And I'm dancin' with my demons through and through  
Just staring into the distance  
For the chance to come around, and take it

My final destination is at hand  
And for the first time in forever  
I feel the resolution, yeah

The shoreline keeps on rising up to me  
Looking for my revolution  
This is my chance to breathe, oh yeah!

\*And waiting on the edge of fantasy  
Is teh crashing roll of thunder  
And the roar of what I wish to believe is the bullet waiting for me
 
\*Repeat
