If you're willing to believe  
Please just free your hands and see  
Me and the toppling memory  
Black hole swallowing everything  
The cars and trees soaring in sky  
Running boys screaming lullaby  
Blasting road lamps flowering  
It would no longer light up

The wind blows out the happy face  
It would no longer light up

(So come closer  
Take a look in my eyes  
You'll see yourself dancing with your smiling tears pouring)

Twisted  
Pass by  
Abandoned  
Can't get it back  
Please don't close your eyes  
Forget the real lies and try to realize  
your dream  
with me

If you're willing to believe  
Please just free your hands and see

Can't you see the stars around us?  
Don't matter what they said about us
