RETRIEVE  
Vocal: HARUKI  
Music & Lyrics: Alex (MELOIMAGE)  

The mind is empty, looking down the street  
Buried in daily routine, you will think everyday is repeating the same  
Ticking clock fills in the blank  
Frontier is not moving till you give a try  

The heart is hungry, looking for a dream  
Refresh the map, liberty do exist in the wildest idea  
Spelling out, words and notes telling you how  
Make or break  
This is the moment calling us to ride on  

Step ahead  
In the air I feel your strength  
Against the headwind you’ll be okay  
Live up to your name  
Nothing will ever ever ever hold you back  

Press the start  
A new game has been set    
The road not taken is turning point  
Retrieve the light deep in your heart  
Heavy clouds suffocate the sight once in a while  
Walls invisible around do not even let you go  
Stuck in a beautiful maze  
Quicksand paves the way  

Now return to zero  
Maybe you will find a world altered angle  
Landscape update  
System reboot in place  
No, we don’t regret  
Draw a line from bottom to the sky  
I stare into the shine in your eyes  
Recall the day  
Nothing will ever ever ever hold you back  

Press the start  
A new game has been set  
The road not taken is turning point  
In aftermath we survive and  

You’ll see the story has just begun   
Hope is never clear, easy and nice all the time  
Don’t be afraid  
We will make a brand new sky
