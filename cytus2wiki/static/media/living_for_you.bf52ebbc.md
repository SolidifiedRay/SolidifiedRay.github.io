Starry skies lighting up the world surrounding you  
Empathy takes me over and completes me  
For the future shines bright into my eyes and  
Shows me the moment soaring through sunshine with you  

Cause I'm living for you, reaching for you, calling to you  
To be mine forever cause life would be complicated  
If we threw the moments from our hearts  

Cause I'm waiting for you, crying to you,  
Holding on to any glimpse of hope  
I just wanna know  

When will I find a moment when we're together  
Will it be in this life or is it hopeless?  
Cause I don't want to be waiting forever for your heart  
If I need to move on  

Cause I'm living for you, reaching for you, calling to you  
To be mine forever cause life would be complicated  
If we threw the moments from our hearts  

If I'm waiting for you, crying for you,  
Holding on to every glimpse of hope  
I just wanna knowï»¿
