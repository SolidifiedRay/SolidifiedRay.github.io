I trust you  
when you wanna be your true self  
everything will make it right  
I believe it  
the dream will take me high and let me free  
what is on my mind  
no one can stop me, try to laugh at me  
nothing can stop me, I'm ready to fight

People said  
you should be stable over a lifetime  
step by step follow the line  
but I can't  
stop the scream from my heart when I stop to walk on.  
no one can stop me, try to laugh at me  
nothing can stop me, I'm ready to fight

I just want to know who I am  
even the pain on the way  
someday I overcome the fear in my soul

I try to go my way  
never say never and never forget  
remember how it began
