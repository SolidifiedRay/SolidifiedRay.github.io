\*完整版曲目歌词

Abandon the vow you have made before

Reveal your Node, await eye code

Open those arms in the shadow

Linking crystals to your soul

(Listen to your fate)

Have you seen the sky? Those stars

(Never seen those stars)

Shine so bright as light in the jars

(Lying to your true heart)

Tell me why you sigh, old scars

(Recall the old scars)

Left machine too tight, shatters into the…

(shatters into debris)

Lies made the cyber fall apart

Ain’t no way to tell the Mars

Do not rely on rusted machine heart

Chase what they always think insane

A button in your brain

Could I delete my pain? Tried to reach you but in vain

Abandon the vow you have made before

Reveal your Node, await eye code

Open those arms in the shadow

Linking crystals to your soul

(Listen to your fate)

Have you seen the sky? Those stars

(Never seen those stars)

Shine so bright as light in the jars

(Lying to your true heart)

Tell me why you sigh, old scars

(Recall the old scars)

Left machine too tight, shatters into the…

(shatters into debris)

Lies made the cyber fall apart

Ain’t no way to tell the Mars

Do not rely on rusted machine heart

Chase what they always think insane

A button in your brain

Could I delete my pain? Tried to reach you but in vain

Ain’t no need to fear...hold my hand…

Abandon the vow you have made before

Reveal your Node, await eye code

Moments that go like a swallow

Linking crystals to your soul

Lies made the time mysterious

Ain’t no way to wipe the tears

Do not rely on world that's malicious

Phase out device no more the same

It glitters in the rain

I beg for the last chain, tried to bind your hope with flames

But I still believe in you

Though dancing in the danger

Secret might not last longer

And I still believe you
