SYSTEMFEIT  
Vocal: HARUKI  
Music & Lyrics: Alex (MELOIMAGE)  

Living with a status issued by the system  
You come up with a question  
No one dares to give an answer  
We are servants, labors, items and components  
All kinds of dedication to the function piling us upon   

Theories are working for people in power  
With nice and pretty reasons  
Telling you what is the best for them  
We believe in those words as told by the parents  
Forget your own ambition  
Like a puppet with no heart   

Fight against the system and take back unique future  
That’s what we used to be but now it’s a funny sentence  
Do you want to change the world?  
Join the world will be much easier  
No need to think where to go  
Just take my order  

Winners take it all, including your dream  
On the side you worship  
They don’t watch you fail but you have noticed  
Pathetic mentality  
A little bit similar to the animals  
They got slaughtered and become ingredients  
Natural selection reveals all the truth  

Merge into the system  
Doctrine will give you comfort  
We are the products of the same type, only inferior  
Personality erased  
Acting like a tool that’s what we do  
Climb up the ladder you see a greater fool  
Fight against the system and take back unique future  
That’s what we used to be but now it’s a funny sentence  
Do you want to change the world?   
Join the world will be much easier   
No need to think where to go  
Just take my order  
Welcome to my hierarchy  
Don’t you return
