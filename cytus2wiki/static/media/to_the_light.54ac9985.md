Watching the sky  
Is there something catch your eyes?  
You found nothing when you lost desire  
In your life!  
All the colors peeled off in your life  
Are you afraid?  
You’re afraid but why you gaze to the sky?  
Fly! For the sake of memories  
Or for the sake of a lie  
Fly! For the sake of memories  
Or for the sake of the sky  

Never let it go  
Believe yourself once more  
Your feathers scattered on the ground  
Is it the change you want?  
Spread your wings to soar  
Wherever you have to go  
Somehow you’ll break through the sky  
Dream will appear before your eyes  

Never let it go  
Believe yourself once more  
Your feathers scattered on the ground  
Is it the change you want?  
Spread your wings to soar  
Wherever you have to go  
Somehow you’ll break through the sky  
Dream will appear before your eyes  

What is in your mind?  
No more regret!  
No more lie!  
What is in your mind?  
No more regret!  
No more lie!  
What is in your mind?  
No more regret!  
No more lie! 
What is in your mind?  
No more regret!  
No more lie!  

So, bring your courage back  
You couldn’t see what inside your mind  
it’ll light up the sky  

Never let it go  
Believe yourself once more  
Your feathers scattered on the ground  
Is it the change you want?  
Spread your wings to soar  
Wherever you have to go  
Somehow you’ll break through the sky  
Dream will appear before your eyes  

Maybe you will find out it’s what you’ve been seeking for  
Realize we have to lose a lot, and we keep stay alive  
The star is shining in the sky, it’ll lead us to the light  
The star is shining in the sky, it’ll lead us to the light
