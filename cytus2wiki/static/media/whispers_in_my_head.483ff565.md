The seeds of fear, buried deep inside  
Hesitation and uncertainty fulled of my mind  
Get away from here, from everything  
No consolation, no consolation  

In your empty inner world  
Empty eyes  
I can't stop the pouring tears  
I can't stop the pouring tears  

Is there any chance to go back?  
Or just another chance to decide?  
Where to go? Waste or face the time?  
Is there any chance to go back?  
Can I wake up before twilight?  
Listen to the whispers carefully in my head  
If I died would you be fine?  
Would you be fine?

The fear has spreaded, everywhere in my heart  
It seems to be collapsed, could not be fixed 

Future means nothing  
No gain but pain, that kills me  
With no piece of faith  
With no piece of faith 

Don't look behind, don't take all your time  
To regret and complain these messes that you can't take  
Don't look behind, why don't you start it from here  
A brand new day'll wait for you tomorrow  

You said you believed, things came to an end  
Too hard to take another breath  
You wish you can just fly away  
But you can't spread your wings  
Falling heavily
