歌词 Lyrics: NICODE  
演唱 Vocal: Kaicy

I am close enough to see your eyes  
but tell me who I should be like  
Now, stop painting black upon the whitest lies,  
stop pushing me, stop, rewind  

Again, I'm close enough to hold your hands  
To ask what it takes to be a man  
So many choices, too many voices  
and I know they'll ony steal me away from you  

Let me be myself
