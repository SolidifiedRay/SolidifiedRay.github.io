I feel the sun hit my soul   
The impact undeniable to anyone  
My heart stores its lies  
I reach the new world  
I see the future  

The angels touch my broken skin  
I feel the light return encompassing within  
I am reborn  
I see our destiny door  
But not like before 

I will stop at nothing  
To fight for you  
Cause all of the pain  
Makes us come together to comprehend the meaning of the truth  

Holding my breath from far away  
Hoping to feel the guide of the light  
Reaching up to stranger things  
Hearing the voices calling me  
Crying out for a pathway to follow  
I wanna be there for the revolution  

I will stop at nothing  
To fight for you  
Cause all of the pain  
Makes us come together to comprehend the meaning of the truthï»¿
