When I lost my way  
You’ve always been there to save my day  
Now I’m on the bed, taking little nap  
Dreaming like you don't need to wake

When all the memories come back  
Somehow I forget how to maintain my breath  
All I see is blackness  
Don’t know how to act  
Try to dream again  
How it’s gonna be  
If you’re still around

You were standing there  
Feel so close but yet so far away  
Come forward step in  
Open up my heart  
Let you stay inside all day long

Someday I will let you know   
I don't wanna bury anything you did  
Try my best to recall  
Too much for me now  
Try to dream again  
How it’s gonna be  
If you’re still around
