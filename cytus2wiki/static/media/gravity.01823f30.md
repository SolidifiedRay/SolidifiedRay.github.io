作词 Lyrics: NiCODE  
演唱 Vocal: Kaicy

Observing the dawn 'till it breaks  
All goes upside-down as the day breaks  
A hundred pieces of thought of the hope were dancing on a rope  
That made me go off the deep end

Don't let the sunshine rain down on me  
as long as the earth isn't far below me  
I'll climb the hills of the sky,  
won't cry here and die  
I want to fly up enough to divide sunlight

\*The stream of false dawn, can't let me down  
Much can be done right for this time and  
No need to be known, still good to the bone  
Ready to drown deep in the sky

I spy overlying wings swing as I go  
Dive right into the free air and rouse the sun  
Eyes may grey-out, I might shout 'mayday', as  
Side wind wails while I fight the gravity

I spy overlying wings swing as I fly  
Beneath the old moon's ray, when the starlights sway  
I may black-out, I may face the fallout  
Though, I'm ready to go, I'm so ready to go

I'm ready to fall

Repeat \*
