A message from the composer:  

Concentric circles are circles with a common center.  
This song proposes the idea that while each individual person have a different way of life, we are all working towards the same goal. Like concentric circles, we are connected because we share a common center and rotate our lives around it.  
It has been more than a year since this song was completed, but it still counts as my latest work. I already planned to re-shoot the video in a better quality, hence why I would like to use this opportunity to reinterpret the theme of this song. I hope that everyone will like it.  

个人渣翻：

一条来自作曲者的信息：

同心圆指的是有着同一个圆心的圆  
这首歌想表达的意思是：虽然我们每一个人有不同的生活，但是我们全部都向着一个目标努力。就像同心圆一样，我们彼此互相联系，因为我们有同一个“中心”并且我们的生活都围绕着它。  
虽然这首歌已经完成了一年多了，但这首歌仍然算我的最新作。我打算重新拍一个更好的质量的视频，所以我打算用这次机会重新介绍一下这首歌的主题。希望大家能喜欢。
