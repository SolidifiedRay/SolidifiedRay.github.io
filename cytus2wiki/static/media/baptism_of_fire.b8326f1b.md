Sitting in the darkness  
Void of a human emotion  
Light is calling out  
But the meaning is lazy

Running from the shadows  
Escape from the feeling inside  
I will find the only one

\*Fight through the starlight for  
My chance to breathe  
Crash through the ether for reality  
Roar of the earth is no fight to be feared  
Baptism of fire is finally here

Repeat \*

Dancing in the twilight  
Flood of the feelings within  
The last night of my life  
In the end we will break free

Meeting the horizon  
Facing the reason that  
I and you are from a world apart

Repeat \*
