Every time we hide  
Into shadow that can make us feel love  
Eat the sorrow drink a cup of fear  
Ready to be found in the darkest place where my soul was barried  
I’m begging don’t set me free~  
 
Trun around and bring the light  
Billion shining stars are waiting to arrive  
Grab your ticket ,we’re about to leave  
Make a wish  

Raise your hand and start to dream  
Swimming with the crowd like we are on the sea  
Nothing’s gonna blow away our tears
