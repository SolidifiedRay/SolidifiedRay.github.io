Trapped in a world of mystery  
Shadows are all closing in and I can't breath  
Escaping possibility  
Around, around is all we know

Is all we know

My heart is breaking through my body and it's killing me  
Suffering is like an eternity  
When will it end?

\*As the walls around me tie me to a fragment of emotion  
The consequences of my being starts to rise  
The fibres of my essence start to float away  
How can I ever stand to fight another day

Born into a world of deceit  
Impossible to rise up from below  
How can I even move,  
how can I even find my soul  

Will it ever be Enough

Repeat\*\*
