Are you sure you’re right? maybe not?  
Who can fix the line of justice?  
Don’t follow anyone.  
Cause, you are the flag,You’re the sign of the future.

When I was needing someone’s hands to hold,  
It was already inside of me from the start.  
Nothing can take me down, wherever I go.  
Cause, I’m just reading voices inside of my heart.

It just makes me alive with the lights so many times to live my life.  
There are no lies, there’s no need to fear, I’m already into the sky.  
So give me the line. As much as I can, I’ll break it through to live my life.  
I can make it shine. Try to make it rise. I’m already into the sky.
Cause, All these things make me alive.

With the lights, make it rise, to live my life.  
There are no lies, there’s no need to fear, I’m already into the sky.  
Cause, All these things make me alive.

So there’s no need to be upset, the future is already set.  
If they’re trapping you like a game, Raise your hands like hunger game.  
Keep your clap, clickety-clack, Stomp your feet and make it crack.  
Even if it’s just too hard, the voice’s always in your heart.

It just makes me alive with the lights so many times to live my life.  
There are no lies, there’s no need to fear, I’m already into the sky.  
So give me the line. As much as I can, I’ll break it through to live my life.  
I can make it shine. Try to make it rise. I’m already into the sky.  
Cause, All these things make me alive.

With the lights, make it rise, to live my life.  
There are no lies, there’s no need to fear, I’m already into the sky.  
Cause, All these things make me alive.
