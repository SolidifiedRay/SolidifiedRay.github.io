Anger and deceit is all I can feel  
The trust that was broken can never heal  
Years of our time with effort and tears  
Just fall to the wasteland

The Stories I heard were beyond my dreams  
A part of this little adventure  
How I was fooled by the charm and the wit  
If you're serious then brace for extremes

For when I am finally free  
Of the torment that couldn't be seen  
The sunshine will finally come and  
Wrap around to save my soul

I'll survive * 3  
And I'll fight on without you  
Stronger!  
Yes I'm stronger!  
Oh, I'm stronger!  
And it's all I'll believe

Letting the past go  
Hard as it seems  
I'll keep moving on as it's always been  

Fall by the wasteland's all I can see  
But I know my future's waiting for me
