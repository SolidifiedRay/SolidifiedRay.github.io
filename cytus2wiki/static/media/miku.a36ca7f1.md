Miku Miku you can call me Miku

Blue hair blue tie hiding in your WIFI

Open secrets anyone can find me

Hear your music running through my mind

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm on top if the world because of you

All I wanted to do is follow you

I'll keep singing along to all of you

I'll keep singing along

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

Miku Miku what's it like to be you

Twenty twenty looking in the rear view

Play me break me make me feel like superman

You can do anything you want

I'm on top if the world because of you

All I wanted to do is follow you

I'll keep singing along to all of you

I'll keep singing along

I'm on top of the world because of you

I do nothing that they could never do

I'll keep playing along to all if you

I'll keep playing along

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

I'm thinking Miku Miku oo ee oo

Where were we walking together

I will see you in the end

I'll take you to where you've never been

And bring you back again

Listen to me with your eyes

I'm watching you from the sky

If you forget I'll fade away

I'm asking you to let me stay

So bathe me in your magic light

And keep it on in darkest night

I need you here to keep me strong

To live my life and sing along

I'm waiting with you wide awake

Like your expensive poison snake

You found me here inside a dream

Walk through the fire straight to me
