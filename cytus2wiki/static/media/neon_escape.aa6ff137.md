Give it all in to temptation  
Let them call me fabulation  
Wanna get my imagination burn  
It’s the only way to heaven  
I’ve been walking with loneliness  
Never knowing who will turn the spotlight on  

Here you are, here you are  
Waiting like a silent star  
Sprinkle the galaxy, spin my steps  
Now I’ve found here you are  
here you are  

Faces of flat expression  
Colors without inspiration   
Here comes another ordinary day  
We don’t need a way to heaven  
Fever’s in my fingertips  
No more doubting here will be a spotlight on   

Here you are, here you are  
Waiting like a silent star  
Sprinkle the galaxy, spin my steps  
Now I’ve found here you are  
here you are  

Here you are, here you are  
Waiting like a silent star  
Sprinkle the galaxy, spin my steps  
Now I’ve found here you are  
here you are  

Here you are, here you are  
Waiting like a silent star  
Sprinkle the galaxy, spin my steps  
Now I’ve found here you are  
here you are
