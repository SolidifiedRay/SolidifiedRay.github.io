Rua feat. K - Still (Full Version)  

「曾几何时，我们不再注视同样的天空，也不再拥抱彼此？」  

I know why they are laughing at us  
I see the sadness spread in your eyes  
once we were dancing, singing  
somehow it all changed  
no one else could understand  

I know why they are laughing at us  
I see the sadness spread in your eyes  
under the moonlight we are scearming   
somehow it won’t change  
stop chasing set me free  

you don't have to swallow your tears  
you still have me  

you don’t have  
to cover yourself  
when no one can be trusted  
i'm still here standing beside you  
but they tore us apart  
even though i still keep you inside my broken heart  

I know why you are hiding yourself  
All these painful dreams won’t be harmful  
We’re falling into A trap that they made  
Depression surrounded us  
Don’t worry we’ll break through  

And before they start to count down we’re already free  

you don’t have  
to cover yourself  
when no one can be trusted    
i’m still here standing beside you  
but they tore us apart  
even though i still keep you inside my broken heart  

you don’t have  
to cover yourself  
when no one can be trusted  
i’m still here standing beside you  
nothing’s gonna stop us  
but we already forget how to hold each other tightly
