\*完整版曲目歌词

Dream, you dream about the scene that you’ve never seen.

Drink, you drink it down with pills that install memories.

Breathe, the last breath of my chest is called misery.

Clean, formatting all this virtual fantasy

Sculpting faces that never fade.

Bleaching the night that never ends.

Painting grass with white and grey.

Masking my pray day by day.

Every time I reach that wall.

Thinking what you’ve done before.

And I’m still that little girl.

But invisible and unbreakable.

You made a life with truth and false.

Forging things you can’t control.

now I become a phobia.

Я Вечный снег,Я Вечный снег

И твой смех весна

А пока Всё бело и пусто

Dream, you dream about the scene that you’ve never seen.

Sculpting faces that never fade.

Bleaching the night that never ends.

Every time I reach that wall.

Thinking what you’ve done before.

And I’m still that little girl.

But invisible and unbreakable.

You made a life with truth and false.

Forging things you can’t control.

now I become a phobia.

Я Вечный снег,Я Вечный снег

И твой смех весна

А пока Всё бело и пусто

Every time I reach that wall.

Thinking what you’ve done before.

Every time I reach that wall.

Thinking what you’ve done before.

And I’m still that little girl.

But invisible and unbreakable.

You made a life with truth and false.

Forging things you can’t control.
