When you see the crimson leaves
Can you hear my whispery
Like I’m calling out those memories in ecstacy.

All the places we could be
All the faces we could see
All the dreams that we could dream
The light is on
The shadow forms
For the night can be so beautiful

*You are like sunshine duration
Shining for the population
People praise for you
Like the ocean
You are happy aviation
No more rules and orientations
Like infinity
Harmonized*

There are sparkles from the sky
Though it’s beautiful but I
Know it’s time to say goodbye
Goodbye my butterfly
And our voices now align
And our hands show up the sign
And our hearts will be alive

Though the lights are gone
And the sound offshore
I could feel that your soul will still go on

Repeat *x2

Sunshine……..
Duration………
