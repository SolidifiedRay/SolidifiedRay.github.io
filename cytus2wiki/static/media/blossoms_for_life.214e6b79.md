=========== Lyrics ===========

《Blossoms for Life》  
Hold their steps, passersby  
The stage unfolds  
By the roadside,  
perfect hue and light, you and I

Just like butterflies,  
perfect hue and light

Blossoms for life~  
Yeah, we do. We did and we will  
catch everyone’s eyes  
Color’em bright  
Yeah, we light up the world side by side

Blossoms for life~  
Yeah, we do. We did and we will  
(Crash a smile) through honey or spice  
blossoms for life. you and I

Walk that miles, nourished by time,  
We’ve waited so  
flowers that thrive  
perfect hue and light, you and I

Just like butterflies,  
perfect hue and light,  

Though it rains down our fate.  
Start up today~

Blossoms for life  
Yeah, we do. We did and we will  
catch everyone’s eyes  
Color’em bright  
Sing the songs we build a paradise

Blossoms for life  
Yeah, we do. We did and we will  
through honey or spice  
blossoms for life. blossoms for life~
