Take me for who I am  
And leave all the rest behind  
Reaching from where you stand  
Just what do you hope to find?  

When I try to find, design, and reshape the signs  
It’s to remind you I can  
But you try deny, rewind, to crash and divide  
But I know where we stand, yeah  

Let’s say we change the game  
And we can brave the days like all others do  
Let’s say we stay the same  
Delay, decay away and I never knew  
It’s up to you  

We’re not giving up just yet  

Every now and then it seems  
We get swallowed up by the machine  
But it’s you that makes me question  
The life I’m living  

Let’s say we change the game  
And we can brave the days like all others do  
Let’s say we stay the same  
Delay, decay away and I never knew  
It’s up to you  

We’re not giving up just yet  

Let’s say we change the game  
And we can brave the days like all others do  
Let’s say we stay the same  
Delay, decay away and I always knew  
It was up to you

We’re not giving up just yet
