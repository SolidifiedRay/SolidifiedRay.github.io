Chasing every start lit dream  
Falling in the ocean of your arms  
There is nothing we can't be  
Here in all the freedom of this love  
As we crash in the wake of the sunset  
Every dream comes alive in your heartbeat  
We are lost in the waves of the moment  
It feels so free  
This is what breathless feels like  
I can feel a sweet release  
With your love there's no end in sight  
It's like eternity  
It's like eternity...
