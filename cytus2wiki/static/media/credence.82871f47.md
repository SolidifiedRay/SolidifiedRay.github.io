CREDENCE  
Vocal: HARUKI  
Music & Lyrics: Alex (MELOIMAGE)  

Day by day you walk the same old path to the school  
Working on the same page like everyone else will do  
Just to memorize texts without really knowing why  
Have a good name and to be approved  

What you think or what you wish is not important  
No one cares until you have fame and reputation  
Plenty of ways will help you climb to the place  
Simply follow conventional wisdom  
Unjustification  

Sending signal to trust someone  
Leaving me no choice but cost to survive  
Tiring of fabricated smile  
Credence only in senseless paranoid  

Sending signal to trust someone  
Leaving me no choice but cost to survive  
Tiring of fabricated smile  
Credence only in senseless paranoid  

Forging fiction we spare no time  
Scaling up trust based on hindsight   
Is this what you really want  
Take a look inside my heart  
Recover our belief before dying out
